# EmployeeDirectory
An application that displays a list of employee from an API using React.



## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information


## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
